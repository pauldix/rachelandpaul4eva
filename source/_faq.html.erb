<div class="faq">
  <h4>What about transportation?</h4>
  <p>
    Cabs from the airport into town cost about $30. New Orleans does not have very good public transportation, however, so if you plan to do a lot of exploring it might be worth renting a car.

  <h4>What should I wear?</h4>
  <p>
    The wedding is formal attire, but we're interpreting that pretty loosely. For guys, a suit would do fine. For ladies, a cocktail dress, long dress or pair of smart trousers would fit in great. On the other hand, if you'd like to break out the tux or dust off your old prom dress, then this is your chance!

  <h4>Can I bring my kids to the wedding?</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the wedding venue does not allow children under the age of 10 (except those standing in the wedding). Babysitters can be hired through <a href="http://dependablecare.net/?page_id=36">Dependable Kid Care</a> or <a href="https://www.care.com/babysitters/new-orleans-la">Care.com</a>.

  <h4>Can I bring a hot date or my bff as a plus one?</h4>
  <p>
    Sadly, probably not. Our venue has very limited space. But please email us and we can discuss.

  <h4>Is New Orleans Dangerous?</h4>
  <p>
    The Garden District is quite safe, but some parts of the city - including the fringes of the French Quarter - can be a bit sketch after dark. If you’re out late, try to travel as a group, and avoid parking on questionable-looking side streets or vacant lots.

  <h4>You're so wonderful, can I come live with you?</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we don't have room for you to live with us, but if you'd like to stay in our New York City apartment the week after the wedding, please let us know! The only hitch is that you will have to take care of our cat and give her lots of love. We will be gone until April 18, most likely. The apartment is a one-bedroom (queen bed), plus there's a sleepable couch and a blow-up mattress. It’s in a good location in Brooklyn, one stop away from Manhattan on the subway. Email us if you’re interested!
