        <p>
          A mutual friend - Rachel Heaton, aka Blade, aka Rayban, aka “bad Rachel” - invites Rachel to go to a book release party. The book is about Ruby, and Rachel thinks, “I love fine minerals!” She wonders why the author, Paul, pays so much attention to her at his party. The next day, they become Facebook friends.

          Paul and Rachel hang out. Rachel drags Paul out to see “Case 39” and to the ice-skating rink; Paul teaches her about NYC karaoke, bodegas and sweet drinking spots. They go bowling and tie two games in a row (scores: 117 and 142). Paul makes a Brazilian feast for Rachel (farofa with bananas, fried yuca with habaneros and white fish with coconut sauce) - the first time he’s ever cooked for lady friend!

          Paul decides to woo Rachel on a spring break trip. Rachel chooses St. Lucia because it’s a new country and has interesting rock formations. They are both nervous about actually spending more than a few hours together at one time. Things work out: they are upgraded to the honeymoon suite and discover a mutual love of 90s music.

          Paul takes Rachel to Bermuda “for her birthday.” He gets horribly seasick on a morning scuba diving excursion, and misses the second dive because his ears won't pop. Undeterred, that evening he proposes to Rachel on their hotel balcony at sunset, with champers! She says yes.

              <h4>Rachel</h4>
              <p>
                Rachel grew up exploring the bayous and beaches of her native Biloxi, Mississippi. Friends often referred to her house as “Noah’s Ark” because of the menagerie of animals found there - chickens, iguanas, hedgehogs, snakes… She and her sister could often be found trapping feral kittens under a derelict bridge, which they tamed and found homes for. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Her love of all thing wild and green led her to study biology at Loyola University New Orleans. After graduating, she headed to Japan for a year to teach English, and then enrolled in an ecology master’s program in Europe. She spent time <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=ED7D4D43A3B262E18BEF88D58421E6E6.journals?aid=9111707&fileId=S0030605312000865" target="_">researching illegal wildlife trade</a> in a peat swamp in Vietnam, where she ate a rat, got attacked by thousands of bees and was thrown off a motorbike. But mid-way through her degree she realized that statistics and data collection weren’t her favorite things, so she applied to NYU’s science journalism master’s program. Writing about science rather than doing science turned out to be a perfect fit - as was New York City. Now, she <a href="http://rachelnuwer.com/published-articles/" target="_">contributes to outlets</a> such as <i>The New York Times</i>, the BBC and Smithsonian. 
              </p>

              <p>
                When not hunched over her desk rushing to meet a deadline, Rachel loves traveling (she’s been to 40 countries), cooking (she does it to spoil Paul) and <a href="http://rachelnuwer.com/photography/" target="_">taking photos</a> (oftentimes of food, while traveling!).

              <h4>Paul</h4>
              <p>
                Paul hails from Denver, Colorado, where he grew up skiing, skating and playing video games. His obsession with computers surfaced early, after his grandmother gave him a Commodore 64c for his 9th birthday. Hooked, he wrote his first computer program in 4th grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                After high school, Paul worked as a PC technician and network administrator in Denver, and as a aoftware tester at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. After returning to Denver, he worked as a programmer at a startup, and later at Air Force Space Command. He moved to New York in 2005 to live in the city of his dreams and to attend Columbia University. He pursued a degree in Computer Science, studying artificial intelligence and machine learning. While in school, Paul also worked on projects for the New York Jets, BBC, Channel 4 UK and Google.
              <p>
              <p>
                Since finishing school, Paul has become an active member of the NYC tech community. In 2009, he founded the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/" target="_">New York City Machine Learning Meetup</a>, which now has over 5,200 members. He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Rails-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B00413PHZU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408916552&sr=8-1&keywords=service+oriented+design+with+ruby+on+rails" target="_"><i>Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails</i></a>, and is the editor for Addison Wesley's book and video series <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/series/AddisonWesley-Data-Analytics-Series/13601.page" target="_"><i>Data &amp; Analytics</i></a>. In 2013, he participated in the startup accelerator Y Combinator and founded the company <a href="http://influxdb.com" target="_">InfluxDB</a>. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and user groups.

                As my older sister, Ra-Ra was my role model when I was growing up. Whether she was making me believe there was a ghost living in our house, tricking me into thinking I could lay an egg or feeding me potentially poisonous flowers, my older sister was always the person I looked up to the most. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the trauma I endured as a child, Rachel and I have only grown closer as we have both gotten older. We have traveled the world together, riding camels in the Sahara, raving all night in Tokyo and taking a one-night trip to Croatia just to say we’ve been there. My big sister still remains my role model and I know her wedding day will be another great memory we will have, together with friends and family.

Rachel and I were the two youngest students in attendance at L'Abbey, an ancient abbey in the French countryside that had been turned into a part-time school. After many late nights of frolicing in the forest and hanging out at the one bar in town, we decided we would be friends for life. Throughout the last decade, we have spent time together in New Orleans and New York. I <a href="http://aliholder.com/site/">play music in Austin</a> and all around this great country, and Rachel often attends my shows when I'm in town. I once wrote a song at her apartment in New Orleans, which I still play today.

                Rachel and I have been friends for nearly 15 years. We met through our high school band, when I was her French horn section leader. After high school, our friendship continued to grow, especially as we planned a semester abroad in France. We lived in France for three magical months, spending every day together and traveling extensively throughout Europe. Those adventures (and misadventures) solidified a deep friendship.

              <p>
                Despite living on opposite sides of the country — or even the planet — throughout the years afterward, we have always managed to maintain our friendship, making an effort to talk regularly and to see each other every year. I am honored to be included in her wedding ceremony, and I am looking forward to the coming decades of our friendship.

                Rachel and I met the first day of grad school in 2010, but our friendship really began in a 
                shared cubicle named Biedler Forest, where, as summer interns for <i>Audubon Magazine</i>, we 
                complained about grad school. The struggles — long hours, high costs, rough critiques — are what brought us together. That cubicle is where I first heard about Paul, too, a super smart guy who shared her love of new experiences and, crucially, travel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, we have danced two New Year’s Eves away, dressed as incarcerated lesbian lovers, and wrapped our arms around R.L. Stine and James Watson - amongst many more times I’ll always remember. And happily, our friendship extends into work. Rachel is an exceptional science journalist and I’m grateful to have her as a writer at <i>Scientific American</i>. Now if only she’d stop trying to set me up with every guy she meets!

                I met Rachel when she was 18 and I was 33, in a tiny village in France. We did not click right away — that happened months later at a Latin nightclub in Paris. Over the last 10 years, she has become one of my best friends and an amazing travel buddy. We have met up in Mississippi and Manhattan, too many times to count. I visited her in Kiso, Japan, where she taught for the JET Program, and we visited temples in Kyoto. Another year, we had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner of cheese fondue in Poitiers, France, before heading to Paris. And she once came to my rescue in The Middle of Nowhere, Slovenia.

                When I first got to know “RachelNuwer,” I told her I wanted to be her when I grew up — she was this incredible 18 year-old!  And, now, I feel the same — she’s still incredible, and I still want to be her when I grow up. I love her to pieces!

              <p>
                Paul was throwing a party at his place in Denver many years ago, and I met him there through our mutual friend Dave. The only really distinct memory I have from that night was that, after asking what he did for a living, he not only told me what he did but also how good he was at it. Since that wasn't enough, apparently, he brought me to his computer and pulled up an e-mail from a client noting Paul's "god-like abilities." I kept thinking, "Why is this 13-year-old boy so full of himself?" But how wrong I was. He was much older.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, we wound up working at several jobs together over a few years, including a software startup and at an Air Force base in Colorado Springs. Things got even better when we moved to New York City within a few months of each other. We've had amazing times in New York and in travels to Brazilian beaches, Japanese temples, Mongolian gers and many spots in between.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suppose there is one thing that is god-like about Paul after all: his friendship.

              <p>
                Paul has always been like a brother to me. It is a relationship that started with mutual dislike but eventually grew into one of mutual respect (at least I think it's mutual). The transition from being just an annoying older brother to a person who I respect might have begun on a camping trip near Creede, Colorado, with several friends. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was in college at the time - although from my memory of the end of the trip, I was definitely of drinking age. We went hiking and backpacking and planned to tackle a random 14er. I had always considered myself the more athletic one of the two of us due to my participation in organized sports and, conversely, Paul's obsession with the video game Doom II (amongst others). That's why it came as a great surprise to me that, day after day, he was in the front of the pack during our hikes - while I was dragging in the back. At the beginning I found it embarrassing, but as the trip continued I felt nothing but pride and respect. And since then the pride and respect has only grown.

              <p>
                In 1989, I was an impressionable young buck of a mere 10 years. The purpose of the Cherrelyn Elementary School visit to Flood Middle School was simple: match each 5th grader with a wise 6th grader who would guide their young protégé in the erudite path of 6th graderness. That is… unless you had the misfortune of being paired with Mr. Paul Dix. As my mentor, Paul ridiculed me for my selection of “pizza” as my favorite food and “red” as my favorite color. But no insult would sting as painfully as my ill-fated attempt at humor: Trying to demonstrate my savoir faire as a 6th grade candidate, I jested that my favorite band was <a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/wMxq55vk9sw" target="_">“NKOTB.”</a> At first, there was a moment of startled silence. But then a twisted grimace slowly spread over Paul’s pre-pubescent maw, and he bellowed for all to hear, “This guy likes NKOTB!!!” Needless to say, the resulting cacophony of adolescent laughter scarred me for life. To this day, I dare not utter a jest to try “to be cool.”
              </p>
              <p>
                All jokes aside, Paul's been my best friend for decades and I owe it all to his disdain for NKOTB (as I, too, loathed the NKOTB-laden airways of 1989). I HEART PAULIE!

                I met Paul back in the good old early nineties, around 7th grade. My brother and I were living in my Grandpa’s house over on S. Pearl and Yale in Denver. We started hanging out with a neighborhood boy, Geoff, who lived down the block. Well, as I’m sure you all know, Geoff’s big bro is the one and only Pauly! Skip forward a few years to high school, and guess who was in the high school band? None other than P himself! 
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus began a friendship that ended up being lifelong. Our summers were filled with volleyball matches, long days on our skates and far more soda than any human alive should ever consume. After high school, we roommated together for years. This was an era fueled by Baz Luhrman, luaus at our house and (family, please ignore this last blurb) enough beer bottles in our recycling bin to rebuild the Taj Mahal. When I recollect my youth, my fondest memories are, by far, those endless summers that we spent skating, roving the grounds of Elitch's amusement park and pulling all-nighters playing video games. Congratulations, Paul! You deserve every ounce of happiness coming your way!

                Xyla is Paul's niece. He has been a fantastic uncle to her (although she does refer to the wedding as when her Aunt Rachel will be getting married). She loves receiving postcards from Uncle Paul and Aunt Rachel's exciting adventures. Xyla also always laughs when she talks about the "Orca Poop" that Uncle Paul and Aunt Rachel sent her while they were in San Diego. In addition, Xyla enjoys playing with all of the fun toys from Aunt Rachel's childhood that she has sent to Xyla. One toy in particular that she likes and plays with a lot is a black puppet bat that came along in one of the boxes. It definitely seems that Aunt Rachel and Xyla both share a fascination of bugs and other generally creepy stuff.

      <h3>Hotels</h3>
      <p>
        Our wedding falls on the weekend of the <a href="http://fqfi.org/frenchquarterfest" target="_">French Quarter Festival</a>. The good news is that there will be hundreds of free live music shows! The bad news is that hotels are more expensive and less available. Many of the hotels we found have early expirations for the block rate and also could only guarantee holding a few rooms. So make your reservations in advance to save yourself some money, and to ensure you have a place to lay your weary head after consuming copious hurricanes and sazeracs!   
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the block rates quoted here, mention the "Nuwer-Dix Wedding" when calling the hotels.

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div class="faq">
  <h4>What about transportation?</h4>
  <p>
    Cabs from the airport into town cost about $30. New Orleans does not have very good public transportation, however, so if you plan to do a lot of exploring it might be worth renting a car.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="faq">
  <h4>Can I bring my kids to the wedding?</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the wedding venue does not allow children under the age of 10 (except those standing in the wedding). Babysitters can be hired through <a href="http://dependablecare.net/?page_id=36">Dependable Kid Care</a> or <a href="https://www.care.com/babysitters/new-orleans-la">Care.com</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
  <h4>Can I bring a hot date or my bff as a plus one?</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, our venue has very limited space. But please email us and we can discuss.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
  <h4>Is New Orleans Dangerous?</h4>
  <p>
    The Garden District is quite safe, but some parts of the city - including the fringes of the French Quarter - can be a bit sketchy after dark. If you’re out late, try to travel as a group, and avoid parking on questionable-looking side streets or vacant lots. Better to pay for parking in one of the secure lots, just to be safe.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
  <h4>You're so wonderful, can I come live with you?</h4>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we don't have room for you to live with us, but if you'd like to stay in our New York City apartment the week after the wedding, please let us know! The only hitch is that you will have to take care of our cat and give her lots of love. We will be gone until April 18, most likely. The apartment is a one-bedroom (queen bed), plus a couch that is sleepable and a blow-up mattress. It’s in a good location in Brooklyn, one stop away from Manhattan on the subway. Email us if you’re interested!

      <h3>Registry</h3>
      <p>
        Our tiny New York City apartment makes acquiring new toys difficult, and your presence at our wedding is the best gift you could ever give (seriously!).
      </p> 
      <p>
        If you do feel compelled to give us a gift, flat gifts would be much appreciated. These will go directly toward the honeymoon fund: Turks and Caicos the week after the wedding, and the Siberian Railway (St. Petersburg to Vladivostok) in the summer. Help us snorkel and drink lots of vodka! 
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who prefer something tangible, we will be setting up a small registry soon. If possible, please make shipments directly to NYC: 184 Kent Ave., A-507, Brooklyn, NY 11249.

        <h2>NOLA</h2>
        <p>
          If you have never been to New Orleans or the Deep South, we encourage you to build in extra time for exploring! The South is culturally distinct from other parts of the country, and there no place in the world quite like New Orleans. From bayous to beaches, historic plantations to century-old cemeteries, and funk jazz to creole cooking, there is much to discover.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help you make the most of your trip (and to avoid the tourists traps!), we’ve put together a few of our favorite sites, tastes and sips in New Orleans, as well as in the greater South.
        </p>
        <h3>Tours &amp; Classes</h3>
        <p>
          There are lots of entertaining, informative walking tours around the city, all of which contain a significant dose of New Orleans history and culture. Here are some options: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><a href="http://hauntedhistorytours.com/" target="_">Haunted History:</a></b> French Quarter ghost, cemetery, voodoo, scandal, vampire and Garden district ghosts and legends tours. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><a href="http://www.magictoursnola.com/" target="_">Magic Tours:</a></b> tours “for the intelligent traveller,” delivered by professors, historians and journalists. Ghost and voodoo, St. Louis cemetery, Garden District and Lafayette cemetery, and French Quarter tours. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><a href="http://www.friendsofthecabildo.org/" target="_">Friends of the Cabildo:</a></b> French Quarter walking tours with an emphasis on history, architecture and folklore. Tours include free admission to the 1850 House Museum. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><a href="http://www.tourneworleans.com/cocktail_set.html" target="_">Historic New Orleans Tours:</a></b> Usual assortment of ghosts, vamps, etc, plus an adults only “Scandalous Cocktail Hour Tour,” which delves into hookers, crime and booze.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are swamp tours that are a short drive from New Orleans. You’ll see alligators (potentially some up to ten-feet long or so!), decades-old cypress trees, Cajun floating homes and more. Well worth the trip, even if you’re not a nature person or whatever. If you don’t have your own car, they can pick you up from your hotel. Lots of options for those but I think <a href="http://www.honeyislandswamp.com/" target="_">Honey Island Swamp Tours</a> are the best. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Mardi Gras tours are arranged through <a href="http://www.mardigrasworld.com/tours/about-us/" target="_">Mardi Gras World</a>. They have “a magical float den” on site. There’s another tour in the Treme neighborhood that focuses on the <a href="http://tremeindiantours.com/" target="_">Mardi Gras Indians and black Mardi Gras</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if you’re interested in learning about the lasting legacy of Hurricane Katrina while also getting a little excercise, check out the <a href="http://ninthwardrebirthbiketours.com/" target="_">Ninth Ward Rebirth Bike Tours</a>. Additionally, there’s a green home you can visit in the Lower 9th Ward called the <a href="http://www.globalgreen.org/articles/global/115" target="_">Global Green House</a>. There are also <a href="#" target="_">bus tours</a> that cover more distance and paint a fuller picture of the Hurricane’s impact on the city and surrounding parishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Cajun, Creole and Southern cooking classes, check out the <a href="http://www.neworleansschoolofcooking.com/" target="_">New Orleans School of Cooking</a>, <a href="http://www.langloisnola.com/" target="_">Langlois Culinary Crossroads</a> and the <a href="http://www.thenoce.com/" target="_">New Orleans Cooking Experience</a>.

          You can take two hour tours up and down the Mississippi River on the historic <a href="http://www.steamboatnatchez.com/" target="_">Natchez Steam Boat</a>, with dinner and lunch options, and jazz played on all trips. There’s also jazz dinner cruises and Civil War battle field trips on the historic <a href="http://www.creolequeen.com/" target="_">Creole Queen paddleboat</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if you don’t have a car but want to check out some plantations, the <a href="http://plantationadventure.com/" target="_">Old River Road Plantation Adventure</a> hits four plantations and has a swamp add-on option. They’ll pick you up by car or you can take their paddle boat.
