        <p>
          A mutual friend - Rachel Heaton, aka Blade, aka Rayban, aka “bad Rachel” - invites Rachel to go to a book release party. The book is about Ruby, and Rachel thinks, “I love fine minerals!” She wonders why the author, Paul, pays so much attention to her at his party. The next day, they become Facebook friends.

          Paul and Rachel hang out. Rachel drags Paul out to see “Case 39” and to the ice-skating rink; Paul teaches her about NYC karaoke, bodegas and sweet drinking spots. They go bowling and tie two games in a row (scores: 117 and 142). Paul makes a Brazilian feast for Rachel (farofa with bananas, fried yuca with habaneros and white fish with coconut sauce) - the first time he’s ever cooked for lady friend!

          Paul decides to woo Rachel on a spring break trip. Rachel chooses St. Lucia because it’s a new country and has interesting rock formations. They are both nervous about actually spending more than a few hours together at one time. Things work out: they are upgraded to the honeymoon suite and discover a mutual love of 90s music.

              <h4>Rachel</h4>
              <p>
                Rachel grew up exploring the bayous and beaches of her native Biloxi, Mississippi. Friends often referred to her house as “Noah’s Ark” because of the menagerie of animals found there - chickens, iguanas, hedgehogs, snakes… She and her sister could often be found under a derelict bridge, trapping feral kittens which they tamed and found homes for. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Her love of all thing wild and green led her to study biology at Loyola University New Orleans. After graduating, she headed to Japan for a year to teach English, and then enrolled in an ecology master’s program in Europe. She spent time researching illegal wildlife trade in a peat swamp in Vietnam, where she ate a rat, got attacked by thousands of bees and was thrown off a motorbike. But mid-way through her degree she realized that statistics and data collection weren’t her favorite things, so she applied to NYU’s science journalism master’s program. Writing about science rather than doing science turned out to be a perfect fit - as was New York City. Now, she writes for places such as The New York Times, the BBC and Smithsonian. 
              </p>

              <p>
                When not hunched over her desk rushing to meet a deadline, Rachel loves traveling (she’s been to 40 countries), cooking (she does it to spoil Paul) and taking photos (oftentimes of food, while traveling!).

                As my older sister, Ra-Ra was always my role model when I was growing up. Whether she was making me believe there was a ghost living in our house, tricking me into thinking I could lay an egg or feeding me potentially poisonous flowers, my older sister was always the person I looked up to the most. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite the trauma I endured as a child, Rachel and I have only grown closer as we have both gotten older. We have traveled the world together, riding camels in the Sahara, raving all night in Tokyo and taking a one-night trip to Croatia just to say we’ve been there. My big sister still remains my role model and I know her wedding day will be another great memory we will have together with friends and family.

                I’m a native Texan and have called Austin, Texas, home for the last five years. I <a href="http://aliholder.com/site/">play music in Austin</a> and all around this great country. I also teach visual art at a museum in Austin when I’m not on the road.

                I met Rachel over a decade ago when we were studying abroad in Pontlevoy, France. Rachel and I were the two youngest students in attendance at L'Abbey. After many late nights of frolicing in the forest, we decided we would be friends for life. Throughout the last decade, we have spent time together in New Orleans and New York.

                Rachel and I have been friends for nearly 15 years. We met through our high school band, when I was her French horn section leader. After high school, our friendship continued to grow in college, especially as we planned a semester abroad in France. We spent three magical months there, spending every day together and traveling extensively throughout Europe. Those adventures (and misadventures) solidified a deep friendship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite living on opposite sides of the country—or even the planet—throughout the years afterward, we have always managed to maintain our friendship, making an effort to talk regularly and see each other every year. I am honored to be included in her wedding ceremony, and I am looking forward to the coming decades of our friendship.

                Rachel and I met the first day of grad school in 2010, but our friendship really began in a 
                shared cubicle named Biedler Forest, where, as summer interns for Audubon Magazine, we 
                complained about grad school. The struggles—long hours, high costs, rough critiques—are what brought us together. That cubicle is where I first heard about Paul, too, a super smart guy who shared her love of new experiences and, crucially, travel.

                Since then, we have danced two New Year’s Eves away, dressed as incarcerated lesbian lovers, and wrapped our arms around R.L. Stine and James Watson - amongst many more times I’ll always remember. And happily, our friendship extends into work. Rachel is an exceptional science journalist and I’m grateful to have her as a writer at Scientific American. Now if only she’d stop trying to set me up with every guy she meets!

              <p>
                I met Rachel when she was 18 and I was 33, in a tiny village in France. We did not click right away—that happened months later at a Latin nightclub in Paris. Over the last 10 years, she has become one of my best friends and an amazing travel buddy. We have met up in Mississippi and Manhattan, too many times to count. I visited her in Kiso, Japan, where she taught for the JET Program, and we visited temples in Kyoto. Another year, we had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner of cheese fondue in Poitiers, France, before heading to Paris. And she once came to my rescue in The Middle of Nowhere, Slovenia.

                When I first got to know “RachelNuwer,” I told her I wanted to be her when I grew up—she was this incredible 18 year-old!  And, now, I feel the same—she’s still incredible, and I still want to be her when I grow up. I love her to pieces!

              <p>
                Paul was throwing a party at his place in Denver many years ago, and I met him there through our mutual friend Dave. The only really distinct memory I have from that night was that, after asking what he did for a living, he not only told me what he did but also how good he was at it. Since that wasn't enough, apparently, he brought me to his computer and pulled up an e-mail from a client noting Paul's "god-like abilities." I kept thinking, "Why is this 13-year-old boy so full of himself?" But how wrong I was. He was much older.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, we wound up working at several jobs together over a few years, including a software startup and at an Air Force base in Colorado Springs. Things got even better when we moved to New York City within a few months of each other. We've had amazing times in New York and in travels to Brazilian beaches, Japanese temples, Mongolian gers and many spots in between.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suppose there is one thing that is god-like about Paul after all: his friendship.

              <p>
                Paul has always been like a brother to me.  It is a relationship that started with mutual dislike but eventually transitioned to mutual respect (at least I think its mutual).  The transition from being just an annoying older brother to a person that I respect might have begun on a camping trip near Creede, Colorado with several friends. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It was while I was in college but from my memory of the end of the trip I was definitely of drinking age.  We went hiking and backpacking and were going to tackle a random 14er.  I had always considered myself the more athletic one of the two of us due to my participation in organized sports and conversely Paul's obsession with the video game Doom II (amongst others).  That's why it came as a great surprise to me that day after day he was in the front of the pack during our hikes while I was dragging in the back.  At the beginning I found it embarrassing but as the trip continued I felt nothing but pride and respect.  And since then the pride and respect has only increased.

              <p>
                In 1989, I was an impressionable young buck of a mere 10 years. The purpose of the Cherrelyn Elementary School visit to Flood Middle School was simple: match each 5th grader with a wise 6th grader who would guide their young protégé in the erudite path of 6th graderness. That is… unless you had the misfortune of being paired with Mr. Paul Dix. As my mentor, Paul ridiculed me for my selection of “pizza” as my favorite food and “red” as my favorite color. But no insult would sting as painfully as my ill-fated attempt at humor: Trying to demonstrate my savoir faire as a 6th grade candidate, I jested that my favorite band was “NKOTB.” There was a moment of startling silence, and then a twisted grimace slowly spread over Paul’s pre-pubescent maw. Chortling, he bellowed for all to hear: “THIS GUY LIKES NKOTB!!!” Needless to say, the resulting cacophony of adolescent laughter scarred me for life. To this day, I dare not utter a jest to try “to be cool.”
              </p>
              <p>
                THANK YOU PAUL FOR RUINING MY CHILDHOOD! All jokes aside, you’ve been my best friend for decades and I owe it all to your disdain for the NKOTB (as I too loathed the NKOTB-laden airways of 1989). I HEART PAULIE!

                I met Paul back in the good old early nineties, around 7th grade. My brother and I were living in my Grandpa’s house over on S. Pearl and Yale in Denver. We started hanging out with a neighborhood boy, Geoff, who lived down the block. Well, as I’m sure you all know, Geoff’s big bro is the one and only Pauly! Skip forward a few years to high school, and guess who was in the high school band? None other than P himself! 
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus began a friendship that ended up being lifelong. Our summers were filled with volleyball matches, long days on our skates and far more soda than any human alive should ever consume. After high school, we roommated together for years. This was an era fueled by Baz Luhrman, luaus at our house and (family, please ignore this last blurb), enough beer bottles in our recycling bin to rebuild the Taj Mahal. When I recollect on my youth, my fondest memories are, by far, those endless summers that we spent skating, roving the grounds of Elitch's amusement park and pulling all-nighters playing video games. Congratulations Paul! You deserve every ounce of happiness coming your way!

                Xyla is Paul's niece.  He has been a fantastic uncle to her (though she does refer to the wedding as when her Aunt Rachel will be getting married).  She always enjoys receiving postcards from Uncle Paul and Aunt Rachel's exciting adventures.  Xyla also always laughs when she talks about the Orca Poop Uncle Paul and Aunt Rachel sent her while they were in San Diego.  In addition, Xyla enjoys playing with all the fun toys from Aunt Rachel's childhood that she has sent to Xyla.  One toy in particular that she likes and plays with a lot is a black rubber bat that was sent with one of the boxes.  It definitely seems that Aunt Rachel and Xyla both share a fascination of bugs and other generally creepy stuff.

      <h3>Hotels</h3>
      <p>
        Our wedding falls on the weekend of the French Quarter Festival. The good news is that there will be hundreds of free live music shows! The bad news is that hotels are more expensive and less available. Many of the hotels we found have early expirations for the block rate and also could only guarantee holding a few rooms. So make your reservations well in advance to save yourself some money and ensure you have a place to lay your weary head after consuming copious hurricanes and sazeracs!   
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the block rates quoted here, mention the "Nuwer-Dix Wedding" when calling the hotels.
